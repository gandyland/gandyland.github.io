		<h2>Hi! I'm Andrew</h2>
			<p>I grew up on the island of Manhattan. I moved to Washington DC in high school and stayed for college. After college I worked security for the DEA and then for a US Senator. I grew tired of this lifestyle and quit to become a bartender. Looking for something more intellectually challenging I came upon coding and was immediately interested in it.</p>

		<h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I come from an active family and enjoy most outdoor activities. I'm an avid snowboarder and primarily bike as a means of transportation around DC. I can't stand the metro and avoid it whenever possible. I'm a big fan of music and dancing and love watching movies. Right now it feels a lot like I'm writing a profile for Tinder. At any given time you will usually find me playing Settlers of Catan or some other board game, golfing, weaving in and out of traffic on my bike, playing lacrosse or exploring the city with friends.</p>

		<h2>Future Goals</h2>
			<p>I have not done anything that has truly pushed me in some time. Coding has been the first activity that I have tried in a while that has forced me to learn something completely foreign to me and so far I have loved it. Whatever the future holds I am hopeful and cautiously optimistic that it will include coding in some form.</p>
