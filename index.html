		<h2>Education and Background</h2>
			<p>Before developing an interest in coding and developing I had a career in private security. I worked on contracts primarily for US government domestic sites. While being a very interesting experience this job provided me little ways to use creativity and any type of objective thinking.</p>

		<h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I come from an active family and enjoy most outdoor activities. I'm an avid snowboarder and primarily bike as a means of transportation around DC. I can't stand the metro and avoid it whenever possible. I'm a big fan of music and dancing and love watching movies. Right now it feels a lot like I'm writing a profile for Tinder. At any given time you will usually find me playing Settlers of Catan or some other board game, golfing, weaving in and out of traffic on my bike, playing lacrosse or exploring the city with friends.</p>
